  <p class="quote" id= "about"> Hi! My name is Katie and I am a professed bookworm who loves nothing more than a good adventure - whether on the page or in real life. I am a full-time reader and traveler with a soft spot for elephants and wombats. I am a firm believer in the power books and travel have to open your mind and change your world! Magic does still exist, if you just look hard enough!

I invite you to take part in the magic by hearing my stories and sharing yours. Here's to many great books and fantastic adventures!

If you have something to share or just want to chat, I'd love to hear from you. Leave a comment or drop me an e-mail at strayrhetorist@gmail.com. Thanks for stopping by!</p>
